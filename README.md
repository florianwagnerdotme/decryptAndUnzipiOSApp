# decryptAndUnzipiOSApp  

"decryptAndUnzipiOSApp.sh" is a bash script executable on UNIX systems. 
This script will make it easier and faster to download/decrypt an iOS App on your testing device. On top of this, it unzips the IPA directly to get ready for the static analysis! 

To Do's:

* implement option for bulk download
* figure out how to silence the output of iproxy and improve the error catching

I hope this helps you to improve your flow of work 🎉📱🏆🎊

Thank you very much for beeing interesting in this script. If you have some spare time and you see something that you would like to improve, contribute to this project! 

All the best,
Florian
