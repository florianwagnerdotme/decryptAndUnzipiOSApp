# decryptAndUnzipiOSApp
"decryptAndUnzipiOSApp.sh" is a bash script executable on UNIX systems. 
This script will make it easier and faster to download/decrypt an iOS App on your testing device. On top of this, it unzips the IPA directly to get ready for the static analysis! 

ToDo:

* implement option for bulk download
* figure out how to silence the output of iproxy and improve the error catching
